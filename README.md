# Reselect

Implemented based on [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect), for fun and learning purpose.

This project supports basic features including `createSelector` and has comprehensive unit tests covered.

It uses *reference equality* by default but allows custom equality checking function,
this can be done by using `createSelectorCreator`.
